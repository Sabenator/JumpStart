-Hey Mick, hows it going with adding recipes? Now do you understand what I meant by spell checking? My favorite mispelling was "InfectousJavelin" in Redemption mod. Took me a while to notice that!

Planned Features:

-More loot Swapping recipes for: Elements awoken, Ancients Awakened, Ultranium, etc (probably in this order)

-The ability to craft bars down into lower tiers from previous game stages (ex. Cosmolite -> Chlorophyte)
     
-maybe a few QoL NPCs

-What ever I feel like.
