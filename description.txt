JumpStart is a mod in progress intended to make the game a little bit less tedious and annoying

Currently it adds:

-A starter bag

-Calamity support for imkSushisMod loot swap tokens, ALL BOSSES

-Some Pre-Hardmode bosses drop Magic Storage components

-Some Pre-Hardmode bosses drop Gem bags.

Planned Features:

-More loot Swapping recipes for some other big content mods (Spirit, Thorium, Elements Awoken, Sacred Tools, etc)

-The ability to craft bars down into lower tiers from previous game stages (ex. Cosmolite -> Chlorophyte)
     
-maybe a few QoL NPCs

-What ever I feel like.
