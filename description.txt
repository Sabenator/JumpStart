JumpStart is a mod in progress intended to make the game a little bit less tedious.
Currently it adds:
	-A starter bag
	-Calamity support for imkSushisMod loot swap tokens up to Astrum Aureus
	-Some Pre-Hardmode bosses drop Magic Storage components
Planned Features:
	-Full loot swapping recipes for Calamity, and maybe some other big content mods
	-The ability to craft bars down into lower tiers, so that when you need chlorophyte Post-Yharon you don't need to go mining.
	-What ever I feel like.
