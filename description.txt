JumpStart is a mod in progress intended to make the game a little bit less tedious and annoying

Currently it adds:

-A starter bag

-Calamity support for imkSushisMod loot swap tokens, ALL BOSSES

-Spirit Mod support for imkSushisMod loot swap tokens, ALL BOSSES

-Redemption Mod support for imkSushisMod loot swap tokens, ALL BOSSES

-Shadows Of Abaddon support for imkSushisMod loot swap tokens, ALL BOSSES

-Some Pre-Hardmode bosses drop Magic Storage components

-Some Pre-Hardmode bosses drop Gem bags.

-Whoever made the mod ImkSushis mod Add-on, I hate you with a burning passion. Have fun spell checking all 137 calamity mod boss weapons manually.

Planned Features:

-More loot Swapping recipes for: Redemption, Thorium, Elements awoken, Shadows of Abbadon, Ancients Awakened (probably in this order)

-The ability to craft bars down into lower tiers from previous game stages (ex. Cosmolite -> Chlorophyte)
     
-maybe a few QoL NPCs

-What ever I feel like.
