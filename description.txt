JumpStart is a mod in progress intended to make the game a little bit less tedious and annoying

Currently it adds:
     -A starter bag
     -Calamity support for imkSushisMod loot swap tokens up to Astrum Aureus
     -Some Pre-Hardmode bosses drop Magic Storage components
     -Some Pre-Hardmode bosses drop Gem bags.

Planned Features:
     -Full loot swapping recipes for Calamity, and maybe some other big content mods
     -The ability to craft bars down into lower tiers, so that when you need chlorophyte Post-Yharon you don't need to go mining. (For a friend)
     -What ever I feel like.
